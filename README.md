# Bank Personal Loan Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan based on their profile data. This can help banks in targeted marketing and risk management.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of 5000 customers with 14 attributes. The main features include age, income, education, family size, and whether the customer has accepted a personal loan.

## Project Steps
1. **Environment Setup**: Installing necessary libraries and loading the dataset.
2. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the data distribution and handling missing values.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Converting categorical data, normalizing features, and splitting data.
4. **Model Building**: Training and validating various machine learning models.
5. **Model Deployment**: Saving the model and creating a web interface for predictions.
6. **Documentation**: Writing the README file and code documentation.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to understand the data exploration, preprocessing, and model building steps.
4. Use the saved model to make predictions on new data.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a predictive model for bank personal loans. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
